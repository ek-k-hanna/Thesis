abstract="We consider the following problem: Given a commitment to a value $\sigma$, prove in zero-knowledge that $\sigma$ belongs to some discrete set $\Phi$. The set $\Phi$ can perhaps be a list of cities or clubs; often $\Phi$ can be a numerical range such as [1,220]. This problem arises in e-cash systems, anonymous credential systems, and various other practical uses of zero-knowledge protocols.",
