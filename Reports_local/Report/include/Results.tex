\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

First the purpose of the paper is repeated to motivate the results obtained below. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate if  and how the VAHSS construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS} can be extended with a range proof to ensure honest clients. Beside this main purpose the aim is also to provide an implementation of such a combined construction and to compare different range proofs and their compatibility to VAHSS. The results for there three questions will be given below in three sub sections.
