\chapter{Theory}
\label{ch:theory}
This chapter will present the theory used in chapter \ref{ch:Methods} for constructing a client and server verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing scheme.  This chapter will be structured as follows, first  notation, theorems, definitions, assumptions  and cryptographic concepts is defined and explained. Then the VAHSS construction \cite{SumItUp}, that this paper aim to extend such that the construction ensures honest clients, is described. In section \ref{sec:RF_theory} different construction of methods for verifying that clients are honest is given. More precisely two different constructions for range proofs and one for  set membership proofs is presented. 


\section{Preliminaries}
This section will introduce cryptographic assumptions, definitions and concepts that will be relevant for the following sections. The purpose of this section is to state information that will be refereed to and used as building blocks for theory presented later in the report.

\subsection*{Notation and setup}
To make the text more comprehensible notation that is used throughout the paper is introduced and defined here.  
%Consider $n$ clients and $m$ servers, to simplify notation define the two sets $\mathcal{N}=\{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal{M} = \{1,...,m\}$. Let $c_i$ and $x_i$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$ denote the clients (data providers) and their respective data. Denote the servers by $s_j$, where $\:j\in\mathcal{M}$.
Let $\mathds{F}=\mathds{Z}_p$ denote a finite field, where $p$ is a large prime and let $\mathds{G}$ denote a unique subgroup of order $q$.  Define $g\in\mathds{G}$ to be a group generator and $h\in\mathds{G}$ a group element such that  $log_g\:h$ is unknown and $h$ co-prime to $p$. 
The notation $y\in_R\mathds{Y}$, means that an element $y$ in chosen at random from the set $\mathds{Y}$.

\subsection*{Definitions, Theorems and Assumptions}
In this section definitions, theorems and assumption that will be refereed to and used throughout the thesis is stated. The assumptions given here are the assumptions that all cryptographic constructions in this paper will rely on. The discrete logarithm assumption and the q-strong Diffie Hellman assumption define below does not hold in the presence of quantum computers. Thus the cryptographic constructions presented in this paper are not  guaranteed to be secure post quantum.

\begin{Mydef}[\textbf{Pseudorandom Function (PRF)}]
Let $S$ be a  distribution over $\{0,1\}^l$ and $F_s\: :\: \{0,1\}^m\to\{0,1\}^n$ a family of functions indexed by a string $s$ in the support $S$. It is defined that $\{F_s\}$ is a pseudo random function family if, for every PPT (probabilistic polynomial time) adversary $\mathcal{A}$, there exists a negligable function $\varepsilon$ such that:
\begin{align*}
|\text{Pr}[\mathcal{A}^{F_s}(\cdot) = 1] - \text{Pr}[\mathcal{A}^{R}(\cdot) = 1] | \leq \varepsilon,
\end{align*}
where $s$ is distributed according to $S$ and $R$ is a function sampled uniformly at random from the set of all functions mapping from $\{0,1\}^n$ to $\{0,1\}^m$.
\end{Mydef}
\vspace{10pt}
\begin{Mydef}[\textbf{Euler's totient function}]
The function $\Phi(n)$ is defined as the counter of the number of integers that are relative primes to $n$ in the set $\{1,...,n\}$ . Note if $n$ is a prime number $\phi(n) = n-1$.
\end{Mydef}
\vspace{10pt}
\begin{thm}[\textbf{Euler's Theorem}]
\label{thm:euler}
For all integers $x$ and $n$ that are co-prime it holds that:
$x^{\Phi(n)} = 1\:( \text{mod n})$, where $\Phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function.
\end{thm}
\vspace{10pt}
From Theorem \ref{thm:euler} it follows that for arbitrary $y$ it holds that $x^{y\Phi(n)} = 1 \:( \text{mod n})$.
\vspace{10pt}

\begin{Ass}[\textbf{Discrete logarithmic assumption}]
\label{ass:DLA}
Let $\mathds{G}$ be a group of prime order $q$, a generator $g\in \mathds{G}$ and an arbitrary element $y \in\mathds{G}$, it is  infeasible to find $x \in \mathds{Z}_q$, such that $y=g^x$
\end{Ass}

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{Ass}[\textbf{q-strong Diffie Hellman Assumption}]
 Given a group $\mathds{G}$, a random generator $g\in \mathds{G}$ and powers $g^x,...,g^{x_q}$, for $x \in_R \mathds{F}$ and  $q= |\mathds{G}|$. It is then  infeasible for an adversary to find $(c, g^{\frac{1}{x+c}})$, where $c \in \mathds{F}$.
\end{Ass}




\subsection*{Homomorphic Secret Sharing}
Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS), first mentioned in \cite{How_share_A_secret}, hides a secret $x$ by splitting it into shares, such that any subset $\mathcal{S}$ of shares smaller than a threshold $\tau$, i.e $|\mathcal{S}|<\tau$, reviles no information about the original value of $x$.  Let a secret $x$ be split into $m$ shares denoted $x_i \text{ s.t } i\in\{1,...,m\}$, then to reconstruct the value $x$ at least $\tau$ shares has to be combined, this is called a $(\tau,m)$-threshold scheme. In this paper the threshold will be equal to the number of shares,  $\tau=m$. A certain type of HSS called \textit{additive} homomorphic secret sharing (AHSS) will be considered, then the secret  is to reconstruct by computing the sum of at least $\tau$ shares, i.e $x = \sum_{i=1}^\tau x_i$.

\subsection*{Homomorphic hash functions}
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a cryptographic hash function, $\mathcal{H}:\mathds{F}\mapsto \mathds{G}$. Any such function should satisfy the following two properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collision-resistant} It should be hard to find $x,x'\in\mathds{F}$ such that $x\neq x'$ and $\mathcal{H}(x)=\mathcal{H}(x')$.
    \item \textbf{One-Way} It should be computationally hard to find $\mathcal{H}^{-1}(x)$.
\end{itemize}

A homomorphic hash function should also satisfy the following property:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homomorphism} For any $x,x'\in\mathds{F}$ it should hold that $\mathcal{H}(x\circ x') = \mathcal{H}(x)\circ\mathcal{H}(x')$, where $\circ$ is either $"+"$ or $"*"$.
\end{itemize}

A  function satisfying the thee properties is $\mathcal{H}_1(x):\mathds{F}\mapsto\mathds{G}$ and $\mathcal{H}_1(x)= g^{x}$ \cite{HHF}. 


\subsection*{Pedersen Commitment scheme}
The \textit{Pedersen commitment scheme} is a commitment to a secret $x\in\mathds{F}$, defined as $\mathds{E}(x,R)=g^xh^R$, where $R\in_R\mathds{F}$, \cite{pedersen}. The Pedersen commitment satisfies the following theorem;
\\
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:C=g^xh^R}
For any $x\in\mathds{F}$ and for $R\in_R\mathds{F}$, it follows that   $\mathds{E}(x,R)$ is uniformly distributed in $\mathds{G}$. If two commits satisfys $\mathds{E}(x,R)=\mathds{E}(x',R')$  $x\neq x'$ then it must hold that $R\neq R' \:\text{mod}\:q$ and 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pedersen_binidng}
    log_g(h) = \frac{x-x'}{R'-R} \text{ mod }p \quad \text{Where p is the prime underlying the field}.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The statements of the theorem follows from solving for $log_g(h)$ in $\mathds{E}(x,R)=\mathds{E}(x',R')$ 
\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{thm:C=g^xh^R} implies that if someone knows the discrete logarithm of $h$ with respect to $g$, i.e $log_g(h)$, this person is able to provide two equal commits, $\mathds{E}(x,R)=\mathds{E}(x',R')$ such that $x\neq x'$. Since the $log_g h$ is assumed to be unknown it is impossible to construct two equal commits hiding different secrets. This means that the Pedersen commitment scheme is computational binding under the discrete logarithm assumption, it is also perfectly hiding of the secret $x$ \cite{pedersen}. 

The Pedersen commitment is homomorphic. Hence for arbitrary messages $x_1,x_2\in\mathds{F}$, random values $R_1,R_2\in_R\mathds{F}$ and the commits $C_i=\mathds{E}(x_i,R_i),\:i\in\{1,2\}$, it holds that $C_1\cdot C_2 = \mathds{E}(x_1+x_2,R_1+R_2)$.

Note that the Pedersen commitment is similarity to the hash function $\mathcal{H}_1$ and the hash function can be seen as a generalisation of the Pedersen commitment.

A Pedersen commitment scheme can also be defined for vectors and is then called \textit{Pedersen vector commitment}. Consider a $n$ dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{F}^n$, let $\mathbf{g}=(g_1,...,g_n) \in\mathds{G}^n$ and $h\in\mathds{G}$ where $\mathds{G}$ is a group of order $p$ as above. A commitment to the vector  $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,...,x_n)$  with the random value $R\in_R \mathds{F}$ is then defined as $\mathds{E}(\mathbf{x},R) = \mathbf{g}^\mathbf{x}h^R = h^R\prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{x_i}$ and the commitment is a value in the one-dimensional group $\mathds{G}$. 

\subsection*{Bilinear mapping}
\label{sec:bilinear}
Bilinear mapping (also commonly called bilinear pairing) maps two group elements from one groups to an element in another group. In this paper admissible bilinear mapping fulfilling Definition \ref{def:AdmissibleBM} will be used. In the definition given here two elements from the same group are mapped.  Generally in the definition of admissible bilinear mapping,  two elements from different groups are mapped to a third group, i.e $e: \: \mathds{G}_1\times \mathds{G}_2 \to \mathds{G}_T$, but in this paper it will always hold that $\mathds{G}_1=\mathds{G}_2$ and hence the definition is given on this form. 
\begin{Mydef}[\textbf{Admissible Bilinear Map}]
	\label{def:AdmissibleBM}
	Let $\mathds{G}_1,\mathds{G}_T$ be two multiplicative cyclic groups of prime order $p$ such that there exist an admissible bilinear map $e: \: \mathds{G}_1\times \mathds{G}_1 \to \mathds{G}_T$. Let $\mathds{G}_1^*=\mathds{G}_1\backslash \{1\}$.  Then the bilinear map $e$ fulfils:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bilinear: for any group element  $g\in\mathds{G}_1^*$ and $a,b \in \mathds{Z}_p$,
		\begin{align*}
			e(g^a,g^b) = e(g,g)^{ab}
		\end{align*}	
		\item Non-degenerated: $e(g,g)\neq 1$	 
		\item The bilinear map is efficiently computable
	\end{itemize}
\end{Mydef}

The bilinear property of the mapping $e$ will later be used to create digital signatures using Bohen-Boyen signatures scheme. Bohen-Boyen presented a signature scheme that exploits the bilinear property of the mapping $e$ to verify the signatures \cite{Bohen-Boyen}.  In short the scheme works as, the signer knows the secret key $x$ and distributes the public key $g^x$. To sign a message $m$ the signer uses the secret key, $x$, and computes $\sigma = g^{1/(x+m)}$. This signature is $q-secure$ to forgery under the q-Strong Diffie Hellman Assumption. Verification is done by checking that $e(\sigma,y\cdot g^m) = e(g,g)$, which holds due to the bilinearity of $e$. 


\subsection*{Zero knowledge proof}
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) is a cryptographic primitive that was first presented in \cite{OG_ZKP}. The idea behind a ZKP is that after successfully performing a ZKP a certain statement about a secret $x$ has been verified to be true (or false) without having revealed any other information about the secret $x$ beyond the statement. Here only non-interactive ZKP that ensures proof of knowledge (PoK) is considered.  Before closer defining what this means the set up and environment of ZKP protocols are considered. A ZKP consists of two parties a \textit{prover} and a \textit{verifier}, further assume both parties has access to the protocol parameters generated by a set up algorithm and a language $\mathcal{L}\in \text{ NP}$, additionally the prover knows a secret $x\in \mathcal{L}$. The prover constructs a proof that $x$ belongs to $\mathcal{L}$, by using a witness $w$ of $x$. Given the proof the verifier can in polynomial time determine if the proof is valid or not. 
For a ZKP to be non-interactive means that there is no communication required between the prover and verifier during the construction of the proof. PoK means that the verifier is not only convinced there exist a witness $w$ but also that the prover knows such a witness.

 A ZKP should fulfil the thee properties in Definition \ref{def:ZKP}, informally the definitions states that: a correctly constructed proof of an instance $x\in\mathcal{L}$ should be accepted with probability $1$, an incorrect proof of an instance $x\notin\mathcal{L}$ should have a negligible probability of being accepted and the verifier should learn nothing about the secret beyond the statement being proved.
 

\begin{Mydef}
\label{def:ZKP}
First define the two algorithms;  \texttt{Prove}$(x,w)$,the algorithm for generating a ZKP of instance $x\in\mathcal{L}$ and witness $w$, and  \texttt{Verify}, the verification algorithm of the ZKP. Such a ZKP scheme  should fulfil the three properties: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Completeness} Given a witness $w$ satisfying the instance $x\in\mathcal{L}$, it should hold that \texttt{Verify}$($\texttt{Prove}$(x,w)) = 1$. 
\item \textbf{Soundness} If the witness $w$ does not satisfy the  instance $x\notin\mathcal{L}$, then the probability  Prob$[$\texttt{Verify}$($\texttt{Prove}$(x,w)) = 1] < \varepsilon$, for a sufficiently small $\varepsilon$. 
\item  \textbf{Zero-knowledge} A proof system is \textit{honest verifier zero-knowledge} if there exist a PPT algorithm \texttt{Simulator} having access to the same input as the algorithm \texttt{Verify} but not the provers input, such that output from the \textt{Simulator} and \texttt{Prove} is indistinguishable, i.e have the same distribution given that $x\in\mathcal{L}$.  
\end{itemize}
\end{Mydef}
 
This paper will consider zero knowledge range proof (ZKRP) and zero knowledge set membership proofs (ZKSM) where the statement that the prover convinces the verifier of is that the secret belongs to a predetermined range or set.


\subsection*{Fiat-Shamir heuristic}
 Fiat-Shamir heuristic \cite{Fiat-Shamir} can be used to convert an interactive protocol into non-interactive, here it will be used to construct non-interactive ZKP. A non interactive  ZKP requires no communication between the prover and verifier during the construction of the proof. In interactive constructions the verifier sends a challenge $c\in_R\mathds{F}$ to the prover that is included in the proof in order to convince the verifier that the prover did not cheat. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic replaces the random challenge sent by the verifier with the output of a hash-function of the partial-proof up to this point. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic converts an interactive ZKP to non-interactive while preserving security and full zero-knowledge relying on the random oracle model (ROM) \cite{Fiat-Shamir} .

\section{Verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing}
\label{sec:VAHSS}
%Consider $n$ clients and $m$ servers, to simplify notation define the two sets $\mathcal{N}=\{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal{M} = \{1,...,m\}$. Let $c_i$ and $x_i$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$ denote the clients (data providers) and their respective data. Denote the servers by $s_j$, where $\:j\in\mathcal{M}$.

In this section the construction of the verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing (VAHSS), that this paper aim to extend is presented. The goal is to extend the VAHSS such that it in addition to  the verification of servers computations client are also verified to be honest. This will be done  by verifying that they do not provide false data. Different methods for verifying the data provided by the clients is explained in the next section.

Before further description of the VAHSS construction, general set up and properties of AHSS and VAHSS is given. It will be assumed that $n$ clients and $m$ servers participated in the construction. To simplify notation the two sets $\mathcal{N}=\{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal{M} = \{1,...,m\}$ are introduced. The clients are denoted $c_i$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$ and their respective data $x_i$.  The servers in the construction will be refered to $s_j$, $\:j\in\mathcal{M}$.

For AHSS constructions, the idea is that each client splits their secret, $x_i$, into $m$ shares, denoted $x_{ij}$. The clients then sends one share to each server. The servers receives shares from all $n$ clients and computes the partial sum $y_j = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} $ and publishes the result. The final sum can then be computed by any party by summing the public partial sums, this gives $y = \sum_{j=1}^m y_j = \sum_{i\in\mathcal{S}} x_i$. For a VHASS construction, a proof $\sigma$ that verifies that $y= \sum_{j=1}^n y_j= \sum_{j=1}^m \big( \sum_{i=1}^n  x_{ij} \big) =  \sum_{i=1}^n \big( \sum_{j=1}^m  x_{ij} \big)  = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ is generated and published. This allows any party to verify the correctness of the servers computations.


\subsection*{Construction}
The considered VAHSS, uses homomorphic hash functions to verify the servers computations, it was presented in \cite{SumItUp} and then implemented and evaluated in \cite{VAHSS}.

The shares that hides the secrets are constructed by making use of a certain polynomial, $p_i$. For each client, $c_i$, let $\theta_{i1},...,\theta_{im}\in\mathds{F}\backslash\{0\}$ and $\lambda_{i1},...,\lambda_{im}\in\mathds{F}$ be chosen such that the following property for polynomial $p_i$ holds,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:pi(0)}
p_i(0) = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij}).
\end{align}
Then if the the shares for client $c_i$ are put to $x_{ij}= \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij})$ and the polynomial $p_i(X)$ is a $t$-degree polynomial defined as $p_i(X) = x_i + \sum_{k=1}^t a_kX^k$. The sum of all shares is , $\sum_{j=1}^m x_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij})= p_i(0) = x_i$, thus the shares $x_{ij}$ adds up to the secret $x_i$  and the secret is perfeclt hidden is not all shares used in the summation. 

This idea is used in the VAHSS construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS}. The construction consists of the six PPT algorithms: \textbf{ShareSecret}, \textbf{PartialEval}, \textbf{PartialProof}, \textbf{FinalEval}, \textbf{FinalProof} and \textbf{Verify}. The clients providers executed the step \textbf{ShareSecret}, the servers \textbf{PartialEval} and \textbf{PartialProof} and the last three steps can be ran by anyone. A full description of the construction and all six algorithms is seen in Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS}.

%To obtain a secret sharing protocol, where any true subset of shares reviles no information about the secret they are origination from, the construction makes use the following polynomial. 
%For each client, $c_i$, let $\theta_{i1},...,\theta_{im}\in\mathds{F}\backslash\{0\}$ and $\lambda_{i1},...,\lambda_{im}\in\mathds{F}$ such that the following property for polynomial $p_i$ holds,
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:pi(0)}
%p_i(0) = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij}).
%\end{align}
%Note that is the step \textbf{ShareSecret} the shares are put to $x_{ij}= \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij})$ and the polynomial $p_i(X)$ is a $t$-degree polynomial defined as $p_i(X) = x_i + \sum_{k=1}^t a_kX^k$, thus $\sum_{j=1}^m x_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij})= p_i(0) = x_i$, thus the shares $x_{ij}$ adds up to the secret $x_i$ if all shares are in the sum and the secret is hidden else. 


%To verify servers honesty a proof, denoted $\sigma$, relying on homomorphic secret sharing is constructed. Each server, $s_j$ publishes a partial proof $\sigma_j$, and it will then be possible for any party to verify the correctness of the aggregation. A detailed description is seen in Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS}.


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\textbf{: Verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing}}
\label{alg:VAHSS-HSS}
\textbf{Goal:} Construct and share the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$, where $x_i$ is a secret value known by client $c_i$, where $i\in\mathcal{N}$ without any client needing to revealing their individual secret. The servers, used to sharing the secrets, computations are verified so they must be honest.

\end{algorithm}

%\subsection*{Correctness, Security and Verifiability}
A HSS and a AHSS construction should satisfy  two requirements: \textit{Correctness} and \textit{Security}. A VAHSS should also satisfy \textit{Verifiability}. The exact definition of the three requirements for Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS} is given in \cite{SumItUp} and Theorem \ref{thm:VAHSS_CSV} states that Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS} fulfils these requirements. 
\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correctness} It must hold that Pr$\Big[\textbf{Verify}(\{\tau_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{N}},\sigma,y)=1\Big]=1$. This means that with probability $1$ the output $y$ from \textbf{FinalEval} is accepted given all parties where honest and the protocol were executed correctly.
    \item \textbf{Security} Let $T$ define the set of corrupted servers such that $|T|<m$, i.e at least one server is honest.  Denote a PPT adversary by $\mathcal{A}_1$ and let the Adv$(1^\lambda,\mathcal{A},T):= \text{Pr}[b' = b]-1/2$ be the advantage of $\mathcal{A}=\{\mathcal{A}_1,\mathcal{D}\}$ in guessing $b$ in the following experiment:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The adversary $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives $(i,x_i,x_i')$ to the challenger, where $i\in[n], x_i\neq x_i'$ and $|x_i|=|x_i'|$.
        \item The challenger picks a bit $b\in\{0,1\}$ uniformly at random chooses and computes $\textbf{ShareSecret}(1^\lambda,i,\hat{x}_i) = (\hat{\text{share}}_{i1},...,\hat{\text{share}}_{im},\tau_i)$, where $\hat{\textbf{x}}_i$ is  such that $\hat{x}_i = \begin{cases}x_i, \text{ if } b=0 \\ x_i' \text{ else} \end{cases}$. 
        \item Given the shares from the corrupted servers T and $\hat{\tau}_i$ the adversary distinguisger outputs a guess $b'\xleftarrow[]{}\mathcal{D}((\hat{\text{share}_{ij}})_{j|s_j\in T},\hat{\tau}_i)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    A VAHSS-construction is $t$-secure if for all $T\subset \{s_1,...,s_m\}$ with $|T|<t$ it holds that Adv$(1^\lambda,\mathcal{A},T)<\varepsilon(\lambda)$ for some negligible $\varepsilon(\lambda)$.
 \item \textbf{Verifiability} Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote any PPT  adversary and $T$ denote the set of corrupted servers with $T\leq m$. The verifiability property requires that any $\mathcal{A}$ who can modify the input shares to all servers $s_j\in T$ can cause a wrong value to be excepted as $y=f(x_1,...,x_n)$ with negligible probability.   
\end{itemize}
The VHASS in Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS} satisfies the correctness, security and verifiability requirements defined above, this is stated in Theorem \ref{thm:VAHSS_CSV} .

\section{Constructions for verifying clients input}
\label{sec:RF_theory}
Range proofs allows a prover to convince a verifier that the value of a secret is in an allowed range. Zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) does this without revealing any other information about the secret beyond the fact that the secret belongs to the range. Formally the ZKRP presented in this paper are constructed to prove the following statement about a secret $x$:
\begin{align} \label{eq:RP_statement}
    \{(g,h\in\mathds{G},C;x,R\in\mathds{F})\::\:C= g^x h^R \wedge x \in \{\textit{"predetermined allowed range"}\}.
\end{align}
Zero knowledge set memberships proof (ZKSM) will also be considered, they prove that a secret belongs to a set, instead of a range, which does not need to be continuous. Formally  (ZKSM) prove the following statement:
\begin{align} \label{eq:SM_statement}
    \{(g,h\in\mathds{G},C;x,R\in\mathds{F})\::\:C= g^x h^R \wedge x \in \Phi\},
\end{align}
where $\Phi$ is some known set. 
 
Note that in the above statements  it is assumed that $x$ is the secret hidden in a Pedersen commitment, which is not a general requirement for range proofs and set membership proofs however only such proofs will be studied in this paper. The range which $x$ is proved to belong to in ZKRPs may vary between different constructions and will be more precisely defined below for the separate constructions. 

%Let $\mathcal{P}$ rand  $\mathcal{V}$ denote the two parties prover respectively verifier, an informal explanation the statements in equations \eqref{eq:RP_statement}, \eqref{eq:SM_statement} is: after successfully performing a range proof  $\mathcal{P}$ has convinced $\mathcal{V}$, that the secret $x$ in a Pedersen commitment $C$ is in an predetermined allowed range (or set) without $\mathcal{V}$ learning anything else about $x$.

There exists several constructions for range proofs and set membership proofs however this paper will investigate two different range proof constructions and one set membership construction. These constructions will then in the next chapter be investigated if they can be combined with the VAHSS-construction described above to ensure clients honesty in the  VHASS construction.

% Before presenting these two a XXX will be given to motivate the choice of these two ZKRP. (TODO )Square based range proofs \cite{Efficient_proof_interval} %what is is and why do not use. 
%Another construction which could be used to construct a prove that a value is in an allowed range is function secret sharing \cite{FSS} % explain what and why not use.

In the two subsections below the theory and construction of \textit{Set membership proofs \& Signature based range proofs}  and \textit{Bulletproofs} are presented. All proofs satisfies the three conditions \textit{completeness}, \textit{soundness} and \textit{zero-knowledge} stated in Definition \ref{def:ZKP} and proves a statement on the form given in equation \eqref{eq:RP_statement} or \eqref{eq:SM_statement}.

\subsection{Set membership proof and Signature-based  range proof}
First a ZKSM is described and then it will be extended to a ZKRP refereed to as \textit{signature-based range proof}, the idea of these two construction was originally presented in \cite{RANGE-SET}. Both the ZKSM and ZKRP constructions are modified compared to the original construction according to the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to be non-interactive.

\subsubsection*{Set membership proof}
The idea behind the ZKSM (and also the later derived ZKRP) is that for each element in the allowed set $\Phi$ there exist a public commitments, denoted $A_i, \: \forall i\in\Phi$.  These commitments are made public in the set-up phase by the verifier or some other party (not the prover). The prover aims to prove that the secret hidden by a pre-published Pedersen commitment, denoted $C$, is in the allowed set $\Phi$. To prove this the public commitment representing the secret $x$, i.e $A_x$  is selected and  used to compute the value $V = A_x^\tau$, where $\tau\in_R\mathds{F}$. The prover has to convince the verifier that  1) the published value $V$ is indeed equal to  $A_x^\tau$ where $A_x$ is a signature of an element from the allowed set  2) the secret in the Pedersen commitment $C$  is the same as the secret hidden by $V$.
%The first two constructions that will be considered here are based on the range proofs presented in \cite{RANGE-SET} and adjusted to a non-interactive construction described by \cite{ZKRP_Morais}. The transformation from a interactive protocol to a non interactive is done via the Fiat-Schit principle \cite{fiat-schmit}.  Non-interactive means that there communication between the prover and verifies while XXX Find. 
%Construction \ref{alg:ZKSM} is a non interactive set membership proof of a Pedersen commitment $C=g^\sigma h^R$, where $\sigma$ is the secret and $R\in_R\mathds{F}$ is chosen uniformly at random.
%The construction allows a prover, that knows the secret $x$, to convince the verifier, who has access to the commitment $C$, that $x\in\Phi$ for some predetermined set $\Phi$ without revealing any other information regarding the secret $x$.  
In Construction \ref{alg:ZKSM} a detailed description of the  PPT algorithms constructing  the ZKSM described above is explained. The notation $e(\cdot,\cdot)$ in Construction \ref{alg:ZKSM} and \ref{alg:ZKRP} refers to an admissible bilinear mapping as defined previously in section \ref{sec:bilinear}.
%This construction fulfils the zero knowledge requirements described in \ref{sec:ZK} and is a non interactive zero knowledge set membership proof.

Put $a=e(V,g)^{-s}e(g,g)^t$ and $D=g^sh^m$. Then use these two values to compute the challenge $c=\text{Hash}(a,D)$. Then given this challenge compute $z_x = s-x c$, $z_R = m-Rc$ and $z_\tau= t-\tau c$ then construct and publish the proof, $\textit{proof}_{SM} = (V,a,D,z_x,z_tau,z_R)$.

\end{itemize}
\label{alg:ZKSM}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection*{Signature-based range proofs}
The ZKSM construction can be turned into a efficient zero knowledge range proof by rewriting the secret $x$ in base $u$ such that,
\begin{align*}
    x = \sum_{j=0}^{l-1} x_ju^j.
\end{align*}
Optimal choice of the two parameters $u,l$ is discussed in \cite{RANGE-SET}. 
Using this notation it follows that if $x_j\in[0,u)\: \forall j\in\mathds{Z}_l$, then $x\in[0,u^l)$. A remark is that the subscript $j$ goes between the number $[0,l-1]$ and not $[0,l]$.
 %This has been wrongly notated \cite{RANGE-SET,ZKRP_Morais} and therefore an explicit proof of this is given in Appendix \ref{appendix:range}. 
 Construction \ref{alg:ZKRP} is a modification of construction \ref{alg:ZKSM} into a non interactive zero knowledge range proof using the above decomposition of the secret $x$.

\begin{algorithm}[]
\caption{\textbf{: Non interactive range proof}}
\textbf{Goal:} Given a Pedersen commitment $C=g^x h^R$ and two parameters $u,l$, prove that the secret $x=\sum_{j=0}^l x_j u^j$ belongs to the interval $[0,u^l)$ without revealing anything else about $x$.

\item\text{\textbf{Prove} $(g,h,C,u,l)\xrightarrow[]{}\textit{ proof}_{RP}=(\{V_j\},\{a_j\},D,\{z_{x_j}\},\{z_{\tau_j}\},z_R)$}\footnote{$\forall j\in\mathds{Z}_l$}\\
 For every $j\in\mathds{Z}_l$: pick uniformly at random $\tau_j\in_R\mathds{F}$ and compute $V_j=A_{x_j}^{\tau_j}$. Then pick uniformly at random three more values $s_j,t_j,m_j\in_R\mathds{F}$ and compute $a_j=e(V_j,g)^{-s_j}e(g,g)^{t_j}$ for all $j\in\mathds{Z}_l$ and $D=\prod_{j\in\mathds{Z}_l}(g^{u^js_j})h^{m_j}$ Given this let $c=\text{Hash}(\{a_j\},D)$. Then for all $j\in\mathds{Z}_l$ compute $z_{x_j}=s_j-x_jc$,$z_{\tau_j}=t_j-\tau_jc$ and $z_R=m-Rc$, where $m=\sum_{j\in\mathds{Z}_l}m_j$. Finally output the proof: \textit{proof}$_{RP}=(\{V_j\},\{a_j\},D,\{z_{x_j}\},\{z_{\tau_j}\},z_R)$ 

\item\text{\textbf{Verify} $(g,h,C,\textit{proof})\xrightarrow[]{}\{0,1\}$}\\
Check if $D\overset{?}{=}C^ch^{z_R}\prod_{j\in\mathds{Z}_l}(g^{u^j z_{x_j}})\wedge a_j \overset{?}{=} e(V_j,y)^c e(V_j,g)^{-z_{x_j}}e(g,g)^{z_{\tau_j}}$ for all $j\in\mathds{Z}_l$.  If the equality holds the prover has convinced the verifier that $x\in [0,u^l)$ return $1$ otherwise return $0$.
\end{itemize}
\label{alg:ZKRP}
\end{algorithm}

This ZKRP construction can be generalised to  prove membership to an arbitrary interval $[a,b]$ where $a>0$ and  $\:b>a$, by showing  that $x\in[a,a+u^l)$ and $x\in[b-u^l,b)$, since then the secret belong to the range $[a,b]$. Figure \ref{fig:interval} illustrates the intuition and correctness of the statement.  Proving $x\in[a,a+u^l)$ and $x\in[b-u^l,b)$ can easily be transferred into proving $x-a\in[0,u^l)$ and $x-b+u^l\in[0,u^l)$, since both $a,b$ are public. Therefore to prove a secret is in an arbitrary interval the steps \textbf{Prove} and \textbf{Verify} in construction \ref{alg:ZKRP} will have to be executed twice. Plus the  \textbf{Verify} algorithm has to be modified to include an \texttt{AND} operation to verify that  $x-a\in[0,u^l) \wedge x-b+u^l\in[0,u^l)$.  In \cite{arbitary_range_opt} an optimised implementation is presented  reducing the complexity with a factor $2$. This rather small reduction is important when a verifier is required to check the range of multiple secret simultaneously.

\subsection{Bulletproofs}
Bulletproofs is a state of the art range proof that is integrated in many real-world protocols,  for example they are often used in in cryptocurrencies. In the following sections the concepts behind Bulletproofs is presented. 
% logarithmic in the size of the range that builds on the inner product argument presented below. which allows a prove to convince a verifier that he knows the opening $\bm{s},\bm{q}\in\mathds{F}^n$ to a Pedersen vector commitment $P_v = \bm{g}^{\bm{s}}\bm{h}^{\bm{q}}$ such that the inner product of $\bm{s},\bm{q}$ is equal to a known value, $c$. This can be done with a proof of size $log\: n$, compare to the trivial solution of publishing $\bm{s},\bm{q}$ which is a proof of size $n$.

\subsubsection*{Notation and Set Up}
Before describing the construction of Bulletproofs, some additional notation is introduces.  Note that here the same notation  that is used in original Bulletproof paper, will be used, hence more details of the notations can bee seen in \cite{bulletProofs_theory} . 


% and will not be redefined instead the reader is encurraged to .  which will be presented here. First let lowercase bold font variables denote vectors, i.e $\mathbf{a}\in\mathds{F}^n$ is a vector with element $a_1,..,a_n \in \mathds{F}$, and uppercase bold font variables denote matrices, i.e $\mathbf{A}\in\mathds{F}^{n\times m}$ is a matrix and $a_{ij}$ the element of $\mathbf{A}$ at row $i$ and column $j$. Given this notation denote scalar multiplication with a vector as $\mathbf{b}=c\cdot \mathbf{a}\in\mathds{F}^n$, where $c\in\mathds{F}$ and  $b_i=c\cdot a_i, \: i\in\{1,...,n\}$. Denote the euclidean inner product of two vectors as $\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle$ and Hadamard product as $\mathbf{a}\circ \mathbf{b}$.

%Further consider vector polynomials $p(X)$ of degree $d$ on the form $p(X)=\sum_{i=0}^d \mathbf{p_i}\cdot X^i\in\mathds{F}^n[X]$, where the coefficients $\mathbf{p_i}\in\mathds{F}^n$. The inner product of two vector polynomials, $l(X),r(X)$ is defined as, 
%\begin{align*}
  %  \langle l(X),r(X)\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^d\sum_{j=0}^n \langle l_i,r_j\rangle \cdot X^{i+j}\in\mathds{F}[X].
%\end{align*}
%The following is equivalent: evaluating two polynomials at $x$ then taking the inner product versus taking the inner product polynomial at $x$.

%Let $\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}$ denote the concatenation of two vectors. Python notation will be used to denote sections of vectors such that $\mathbf{a}_{[:l]} = (a_1,...,a_l)$ and $\mathbf{a}_{[l:]} = (a_{l+1},...,a_n)$ for $l\in[1,n]$. 

%For $k\in\mathds{F}^*$ let $\mathbf{k}^n=(1,k,k^2,...,k^{n-1})$, i.e the vector containing the $n$ fist powers of $k$. 

%Let $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}\in\mathds{G}^n$ and remember that $\mathbf{a}\in\mathds{F}^n$ then define $C= \mathbf{g}^\mathbf{a} = \prod_{i=1}^ng_i^{a_i}\in\mathds{G}$, where $C$ can be interpreted as a commitment to the vector $\mathbf{a}$. In this section the two vectors $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}$ will be considered to be generators of the space $\mathds{G}^n$.

In this section $n$ will denote the dimension of the room not the number of clients as earlier. Further remark that, the dimension of the room is the length of the bit representation of the secret in the Pedersen vector commitment, potentially padded with zeros.

Both in the construction of the inner product argument and the Bulletproof the parameters $g,h,\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},u$ are assumed to be pre-shared and known by both verifier and prover. The group elements $g,h$ are as before. Further the two vectors $\mathbf{g}, \mathbf{h} \in \mathds{G}^n$ are assumed to be independent generators of the space $\mathds{G}^n$. The variable $u\in\mathds{G}$ is such that there is no known discrete logarithmic relation between $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}$. In order to ensure the fairness and correctness of the parameters $g,h,\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},u$ they can be  assumed to be chosen by some trusted third party. Another possibility that drops the assumption of a trusted setup is to use the \textit{Nothing Up My Sleeve} (NUMS) strategy, \cite{ZKRP_Morais}.

\subsubsection*{Inner product argument}
\label{sec:inner_prod}
The Bulletproof construction is based on the inner product argument which will be closer presented in this section. The inner product argument is an argument of knowledge that $\textbf{s},\mathbf{q}$ in a Pedersen vector commitment $P_v=\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{s}\mathbf{h}^\mathbf{q}$ satisfies a given inner product denoted $c$. 
%(To differ from the Pedersen vector commitment considered here and the Pedersen commitment in the range proofs the exponents in the commit are denoted $\mathbf{s},\mathbf{r}$ instead of $\sigma,R$, and the commitment by $P_v$) 
More formally the argument is a proof system of the statement,
\begin{align*}
    \{(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}\in\mathds{G}^n,\:P_v\in\mathds{G},\:c\in\mathds{F};\: \mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\in\mathds{F}^n) : \: P_v=\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{s}\mathbf{h}^\mathbf{q}\wedge\: c =\langle\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\rangle\}
\end{align*}
Which can be shown to be equivalent to a proof of the statement,
\begin{align*}
    \{(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}\in\mathds{G}^n,\: u,P_v\in\mathds{G};\: \mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\in\mathds{F}^n) : \: P_v=\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{s}\mathbf{h}^\mathbf{q}u^{\langle\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\rangle}\}.
\end{align*}

A logarithmic sized proof of the above inner product statement is presented in Construction \ref{alg:inner_product} in Appendix \ref{App:innerP}. The presented  construction is modified compared to the one presented in \cite{bulletProofs_theory} to be non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

\end{itemize}
\label{alg:inner_product}
\end{algorithm}
\end{comment}


%The setup phase of construction \ref{alg:inner_product} is intently left out since to avoid a trusted third party a \textit{Nothing up my sleeve} strategy will be used and is described separately in  section \ref{sec:NOMS}.
 
Remark that the inner product argument is sound but not zero-knowledge since information about two exponentials $\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}$ is reviled.

\subsubsection*{Bulletproofs construction}
Here the logarithmic sized range proof called \textit{Bulletproof}, based  on the inner product argument, is presented. This construction allows a prover, given a Pedersen commitment $C=g^x h^R$, of the secret $x$, to convince a verifier that the secret belongs to the interval $[0,2^n)$. This is achieved by convincing the verifier that  $\bm{x}\in\{0,1\}^n$ is the binary representation of the secret $x$, or equivalently that $x= \langle \bm{x},\mathbf{2}^n\rangle $ and that the prover knows $\bm{x}$.
   % \item $\bm{\bar{x}}$ is the component-wise complement of $\bm{x}$. This is equivalent to show that $\bm{\bar{x}}$ satisfies the two conditions: $\bm{\bar{x}}\circ \bm{x}=\bm{0}^n$ and $\bm{\bar{x}} = \bm{x} -\bm{1}^n \: \text{mod }2$.
%\end{itemize}
This can be shown to be done by proving the following statement;
\begin{align}
    \big\langle \bm{x} -z\cdot \bm{1}^n, \bm{y}^n\circ (\bm{\bar{x}} + z \cdot\bm{1}^n) + z^2\cdot\bm{2}^n \big\rangle = z^2\cdot x+ \delta(y,z),
    \label{eq:range_non_zero}
\end{align}
where $\bar{\bm{x}}$ is the component-wise complement of $\bm{x}$ and $\delta(y,z) = (z-z^2)\cdot\langle\bm{1}^n,\bm{y}^n\rangle-z^3\langle \bm{1}^n,\bm{2}^n\rangle\in\mathds{F}$.
The values $z$ and $y$ are either chosen at random from the set $\mathds{F}$ by the verifier in an interactive construction or is the output of a hash function in a non-interactive construction. Here a non-interactive construction will be considered. 

Directly using an inner product argument presented in Construction \ref{alg:inner_product} to prove the statement  in equation \eqref{eq:range_non_zero} would leak information about $x$, since information about the two vectors $\bm{x},\bm{\bar{x}}$ is revealed, i.e the binary representation of $x$. Hence two new vectors $\bm{s}_1,\bm{s}_2$ are introduced and will serve as blinding vectors and help construct a zero-knowledge range proof. Note that this results in that the bulletproof is zero-knowledge  despite that the inner product argument is not a zero knowledge construction. Given this idea, the inner product in \eqref{eq:range_non_zero} is tweaked to include the two blinding vectors and the new statement is to prove the inner product of is,
\begin{align*}
     t(X) &= \langle  l(X),r(X)\rangle = t_0 + t_1\cdot X + t_2\cdot X^2\\
    l(X) &= \bm{x} -z\cdot \bm{1}^n +\bm{s}_1\cdot X\\
    r(X) &= \bm{y}^n\circ (\bm{\bar{x}} + z \cdot\bm{1}^n + \bm{s}_2\cdot X)+ z^2\cdot\bm{2}^n,\\
\end{align*}
Note that $t_0 = z^2 \cdot x + \delta(y,z)$ which is equal to the right hand side of equation \eqref{eq:range_non_zero}. Further it holds that $t_1 = \langle \bm{x}-z\cdot \bm{1}^n , \bm{y}^n\circ \bm{s_R}\rangle + \langle\bm{s_L},\bm{y}^n\circ (\bm{a_R}+z\cdot\bm{1}^n) + z\cdot \bm{2}^n\rangle$ and $t_2 =\langle \bm{s_L}, \bm{y}^n \circ \bm{s_R}\rangle $. Given these vectors, Construction \ref{alg:bullet} gives a non interactive zero knowledge range proof that the secret $x$ belongs to the interval $[0,2^n]$.

Given this let $T_1=g^{t_1}h^{\tau_1}$ and $T_2=g^{t_2}h^{\tau_2}$, next let $X=\text{Hash}(T_1,T_2)$. Now construct the two vectors for the inner product argument: $\bm{l} = \bm{x}-z\cdot \bm{1}^n-\bm{s_L}\cdot X$, $\bm{r}= \bm{y}^n\circ(\bar{\bm{x}}+ z\cdot \bm{1}^n+\bm{s_R}\cdot X ) + z^2\ X $ and calculate the inner product $\hat{t} = \langle \bm{l},\bm{r}\rangle$. Finally compute $\tau_X = \tau_2 x^2 + \tau_1 X + z^2 R$ and $\mu = \alpha+ R\:X$.  Now use the inner product argument to prove that $\hat{t}$ is indeed the inner product of the two vectors $\mathbf{l},\mathbf{r}$ using the commitment $P_v = \bm{g}^{\bm{l}}\bm{h}^{\bm{r}}$, run the algorithm  \textbf{Prove}  defined Construction \ref{alg:inner_product} with the input $(\bm{g},\bm{h},u,P_v,\hat{t},\bm{l},\bm{r})$ to construct such a proof denoted  \textit{proof$_{IP}$}. Combine and publish  the proof: $\textit{proof}_{RP} = (\tau_X, \mu , \hat{t}, P, A, S, T_1, T_2 , P_v ,\textit{proof}_{IP}) $.

\item\text{\textbf{Verify} $(g,h,C,\textit{proof}_{RP})\xrightarrow[]{}\{0,1\}$}\\
Compute the three hash functions $y= \text{Hash}(A,S)$, $z= \text{Hash}(A,S,y)$ and $X= \text{Hash}(T_1,T_2)$. Then given  $y,z,X$ compute $h_i' = h_i ^{y^{-i+1}}$ for all $i\in\{1,...,n\}$, $P_l = P\cdot h\mu$ and $P_r = A\cdot S ^x \bm{g}^ {-z}\bm{h'}^{z\bm{y}^n+z^2\cdot \bm{2}^n}$. Then check if the following equalities hold: $P_l\overset{?}{=} P_r \wedge g^{\hat{t}}h^{\tau_X} \overset{?}{=}  P ^{z^2}\:g^{\delta(y,z)}\:T_1^x\:T_2^{x^2}$ and if the output of \textbf{Verify} in Construction \ref{alg:inner_product} on the input $(\text{proof}_{IP})$ is $1$. If all three criterion is fulfilled then the secret  $x$ in the commitment $P$ is in the range $[0,2^n]$.

%Bulletproofs can be modified to prove that a secret belongs to an arbitrary range, $[a,b]$, with a similar approach as presented for the signature based range proofs and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:interval}. Remember that the range cannot be completely arbitrary it must hold that $a>0$ and $b>a$. A Bulletproof where one prover wishes to verify the range of several commitments can be optimised such that the  proof size does not growing multiplicatively in the number of commits but instead grows additive. More precisely lets a assume a prover wants to prove the range of $k$ commits a naive implementation would lead to a proof size of $k\cdot log_2 n $, but an optimised implementation reduces this to $log_2 n + 2 log_2 k$.  Hence for the case of arbitrary intervals  proof size is increased with the additive term $2log_2 2 = 2$.
