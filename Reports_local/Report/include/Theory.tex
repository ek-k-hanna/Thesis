\chapter{Theory}
This chapter will present the theory behind the client and server verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing construction described in section \ref{sec:Methods}.  First  the preliminaries are described, including notation, theorems/definitions, assumptions  and cryptographic preliminaries /concepts. Then the VAHSS \cite{SumItUp} \cite{VAHSS} construction, which this reports aims to extend to include  a verification of clients input   Finally two  range proof constructions, refereed to as \textit{signature-based range proof} and \textit{bulletproof}, is described. 


\section{Preliminaries}
Here relevant background for the cryptographic constructions presented later is given. 
\subsection*{Notation and setup}
To make the text more comprehensible notation that is used throughout the paper is introduced and defined here.  

%Consider $n$ clients and $m$ servers, to simplify notation define the two sets $\mathcal{N}=\{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal{M} = \{1,...,m\}$. Let $c_i$ and $x_i$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$ denote the clients (data providers) and their respective data. Denote the servers by $s_j$, where $\:j\in\mathcal{M}$.


Let $\mathds{F}=\mathds{Z}_p$ denote a finite field, where $p$ is a large prime and let $\mathds{G}$ denote a unique subgroup of order $q$.  Define $g\in\mathds{G}$ to be a group generator and $h\in\mathds{G}$ a group element such that  $log_g\:h$ is unknown. 

The variable $x\in\mathds{F}$ will consistently denote a secret, i.e the value is not know to all parties in the protocol, and the variable $R\in\R\mathds{F}$ will denote a randomly chosen value that hides the secret $x$. The notation $y\in_R\mathds{Y}$, means that an element $y$ in chosen at random from the set $\mathds{Y}$.

\subsection*{Definitions, Theorems and Assumptions}
%TODO INTRO

The discrete logarithm assumption and q-strong Diffie Hellman assumption define below does not hold in the presence of quantum computers. All cryptographic constructions presented in this paper relies on one or both of these two assumptions, hence the security is not guaranteed post quantum. 

\begin{Mydef}[\textbf{Pseudorandom Function (PRF)}]
%TODO
\end{Mydef}

\begin{Mydef}[\textbf{Euler's totient function}]
The function $\Phi(n)$ is defined as the counter of the number of integers that are relative primes to $n$ in the set $\{1,...,n\}$ . Note if $n$ is a prime number $\phi(n) = n-1$.
\end{Mydef}
\vspace{10pt}
\begin{thm}[\textbf{Euler's Theorem}]
\label{thm:euler}
For all integers $x$ and $n$ that are co-prime it holds that:
$x^{\Phi(n)} = 1\:( \text{mod n})$, where $\Phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function.
\end{thm}
\vspace{10pt}
From Theorem \ref{thm:euler} it follows that for arbitrary $y$ it holds that $x^{y\Phi(n)} = 1 \:( \text{mod n})$.
\vspace{10pt}

\begin{Ass}[\textbf{Discrete logarithmic assumption}]
\label{ass:DLA}
Let $\mathds{G}$ be a group of prime order $q$, a generator $g\in \mathds{G}$ and an arbitrary element $y \in\mathds{G}$, it is  infeasible to find $x \in \mathds{Z}_q$, such that $y=g^x$
\end{Ass}
\vspace{10pt}
\begin{Ass}[\textbf{q-strong Diffie Hellman Assumption}]
 Given a group $\mathds{G}$, a random generator $g\in \mathds{G}$ and powers $g^x,...,g^{x_q}$, for $x \in_R \mathds{F}$ and  $q= |\mathds{G}|$. It is then  infeasible for an adversary to find $(c, g^{\frac{1}{x+c}})$, where $c \in \mathds{F}$.
\end{Ass}


\subsection*{Homomorphic Secret Sharing}
Secret sharing, first mentioned in \cite{How_share_A_secret}, hides a secret $x$ by splitting it into shares, where any subset $\mathcal{S}$ of shares smaller than a threshold $\tau$, i.e $|\mathcal{S}|<\tau$, reviles no information about the original value of $x$.  Let a secret $x$ be split into $m$ shares denoted $x_i \text{ s.t } i\in\{1,...,m\}$, then in order to reconstruct the value $x$ at least $\tau$ shares has to be combined, this is called a $(\tau,m)$-threshold scheme. Here the threshold is equal to the number of shares,  $\tau=m$. Further in this paper additive secret sharing scheme is considered, this means that to reconstruct the secret at least $\tau$ shares are added, $x = \sum_{i=1}^\tau x_i$,

\subsection*{Homomorphic hash functions}
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a cryptographic hash function, $\mathcal{H}:\mathds{F}\to \mathds{G}$. Any such function should satisfy the following two properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collision-resistant} It should be hard to find $x,x'\in\mathds{F}$ such that $x\neq x'$ and $\mathcal{H}(x)=\mathcal{H}(x')$.
    \item \textbf{One-Way} It should be computationally hard to find $\mathcal{H}^{-1}(x)$.
\end{itemize}

A homomorphic hash function should also satisfy the following property:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homomorphism} For any $x,x'\in\mathds{F}$ it should hold that $\mathcal{H}(x\circ x') = \mathcal{H}(x)\circ\mathcal{H}(x')$. Where $\circ$ is either $"+"$ or $"*"$.
\end{itemize}

A such function satisfying the thee properties is $\mathcal{H}_1(x):\mathds{F}\to\mathds{G}$ and $\mathcal{H}_1(x)= g^{x}$ \cite{HHF}. 


\subsection*{Pedersen Commitment scheme}
Define a commitment to a secret $x\in\mathds{F}$ as $\mathds{E}(x,R)=g^xh^R$, where $R\in_R\mathds{F}$, this commitment is known as \textit{Pedersen commitment} and originally presented in \cite{pedersen}. This commitment satisfies the following theorem;
\\
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:C=g^xh^R}
For any $x\in\mathds{F}$ and for $R\in_R\mathds{F}$, it follows that   $\mathds{E}(x,R)$ is uniformly distributed in $\mathds{G}$. If we have two commits satisfying $\mathds{E}(x,R)=\mathds{E}(x',R')$  $x\neq x'$ and  $x\neq x'$ then it must hold that $R\neq R' \:\text{mod}\:q$ and 
\begin{equation*}
    log_g(h) = \frac{x-x'}{R'-R} \text{ mod }N.
\end{equation*}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The statements of the theorem follows from solving for $log_g(h)$ in $\mathds{E}(x,R)=\mathds{E}(x',R')$ 
\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{thm:C=g^xh^R} implies that if someone knows the discrete logarithm of $h$ with respect to $g$, i.e $log_g(h)$, this person is able to provide two equal commits, $\mathds{E}(x,R)=\mathds{E}(x',R')$ such that $x\neq x'$. However the $log_g h$ is assumed to be unknown hence it is not possible to construct two equal commits hiding different secrets. This means that the Pedersen commitment scheme is computational binding under the discrete logarithm assumption, it is also perfectly hiding of the secret $x$ \cite{pedersen}. 

Further note that Pedersen commitment is homomorphic. Hence for arbitrary messages $x_1,x_2\in\mathds{F}$, random values $R_1,R_2\in_R\mathds{F}$ and the commits $C_i=\mathds{E}(x_i,R_i),\:i\in\{1,2\}$, it holds that $C_1\cdot C_2 = \mathds{E}(x_1+x_2,R_1+R_2)$.

A final remark is the similarity between the hash function $\mathcal{H}_1$ and the Pedersen commitment $\mathds{E}$, the hash function can be seen as a generalisation of the Pedersen commitment. This will be used to including verification of client in the VAHSS construction \cite{SumItUp}.

\subsection*{Bilinear mapping}

\label{sec:bilinear}

\subsection*{Zero knowledge proof}
Zero-knowledge proofs  (ZKP) was first presented in \cite{OG_ZKP}. A ZKP consist of two parties: \textit{Prover} \& \textit{Verifier} and satisfies the properties  in Definition \ref{def:ZKP}. After successfully performing a ZKP the prover has convinced the verifier that a certain statement of a secret $x$ is true without having relieved any other information about $x$. This is done by providing a witness $w$ of the statement. In this paper ZKP that ensures proof of knowledge (PoK) is of interest,  this means that the verifier is now only convinced that the statement is true but also that the prover knows the value of secret $x$.  Further this paper will study zero knowledge range proof (ZKRP) where the statement that the prover convinces the verifier of is that the value of secret belongs to a predetermined interval.

\begin{Mydef}
\label{def:ZKP}
%TODO
A ZKP should fulfill the three properties: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Completeness} 
\item \textbf{Soundness} 
\item  \textbf{Zero-knowledge}
\end{itemize}
\end{Mydef}

\subsection*{Fiat-Shamir heuristic}
 Fiat-Shamir heuristic \cite{Fiat-Shamir} can be used to convert an interactive protocol into non interactive, here it will be used to construct non-interactive ZKP. A non interactive  ZKP requires no communication between the prover and verifier during the construction of the proof. In Interactive constructions the verifier sends a challenge $c\in_R\mathds{F}$ to the prover that is included in the proof in order to convince the verifier that the prover did not cheat. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic replaces the random challenge sent by the verifier with the output of a hash-function of the partial-proof up to this point. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic converts an interactive ZKP to non-interactive plus preserves security and full zero-knowledge relying on the random oracle model (ROM). 

\section{Verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing}
\label{sec:VAHSS}
%Consider $n$ clients and $m$ servers, to simplify notation define the two sets $\mathcal{N}=\{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal{M} = \{1,...,m\}$. Let $c_i$ and $x_i$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$ denote the clients (data providers) and their respective data. Denote the servers by $s_j$, where $\:j\in\mathcal{M}$.

This section will describe a verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing (VAHSS) Lets assume  $n$ clients/data providers and $m$ servers, to simplify notation define the two sets $\mathcal{N}=\{1,...,n\}$ and $\mathcal{M} = \{1,...,m\}$. Let $c_i$ and $x_i$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$ denote the clients (data providers) and their respective data. Denote the servers by $s_j$, $\:j\in\mathcal{M}$. The idea of VAHSS is that each client split their secret $x_i$ into $m$ shares, denoted $x_{ij}$ and sends one share to each server. The servers receives shares from all $n$ clients and computes the partial output $y_j = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} $ and publishes the result. The final result is the sum of all partial results, $y = \sum_{j=1}^m y_j$ and can then be computed by any party. In verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing a proof $\sigma$ that verifies that $y= \sum_{j=1}^n y_j= \sum_{j=1}^m \big( \sum_{i=1}^n  x_{ij} \big) =  \sum_{i=1}^n \big( \sum_{j=1}^m  x_{ij} \big)  = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ is generated and published. This allows any party to verify the correctness of the severs computations. Remark that the individual secrets $x_i$ is never revealed in the protocol.


\subsection*{Construction}
A construction of VAHSS was presented in \cite{SumItUp} and later implemented by \cite{VAHSS}. The construction consists of the six PPT (probabilistic polynomial time) algorithms: \textbf{ShareSecret}, \textbf{PartialEval}, \textbf{PartialProof}, \textbf{FinalEval}, \textbf{FinalProof} and \textbf{Verify}. The clients/data providers executed the step \textbf{ShareSecret}, the servers \textbf{PartialEval} and \textbf{PartialProof} and the last three steps can run by anyone. A full discription of the construction and all six algorithms is seen in Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS}.

To obtain a secret sharing protocol such that any true subset of shares reviles no information about the secret the construction makes use the following polynomial. For each client, $c_i$, let $\theta_{i1},...,\theta_{im}\in\mathds{F}\backslash\{0\}$ and $\lambda_{i1},...,\lambda_{im}\in\mathds{F}$ such that the following property for polynomial $p_i$ holds,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:pi(0)}
p_i(0) = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij}).
\end{align}

Note that is the step \textbf{ShareSecret} the shares are put to $x_{ij}= \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij})$ and the polynomial $p_i(X)$ is a $t$-degree polunomial defined as $p_i(X) = x_i + \sum_{k=1}^t a_kX^k$, thus $\sum_{j=1}^m x_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}p_i(\theta_{ij})= p_i(0) = x_i$. Which shows that the proposed shares $x_{ij}$ does adds to the secret $x_i$ if all shares are in the sum and the secret is hidden else. 


%To verify servers honesty a proof, denoted $\sigma$, relying on homomorphic secret sharing is constructed. Each server, $s_j$ publishes a partial proof $\sigma_j$, and it will then be possible for any party to verify the correctness of the aggregation. A detailed description is seen in Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS}.


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\textbf{: Verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{ShareSecret $(1^\lambda,i,x_i)\xrightarrow[]{}(\pi_i,\{x_{ij}\}_{j\in\mathcal{M}})$}\\
Pick uniformly at random $\{a_i\}_{i\in\{1,..,t\}}\in\mathds{F}$ and a $t$-degree polynomial $p_i$ on the form $p_i(X) = x_i + a_1X+...+a_tX^t$. Let $\mathcal{H}:x\mapsto g^x$
% (g generator the multiplicative group of $\mathds{F}$)
, be a collision-resistant homomorphic hash function. Let $R_i\in\mathds{F}$ be the output of a PRF. Where it is required that  $R_n\in \mathds{F}$  satisfies
$R_n = \phi(N)\lceil \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}R_i}{\phi(N)}\rceil- \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}R_i $. Compute $\tau_i = \mathcal{H}(x_i+R_i)$, and put $x_{ij}=\lambda_{i,j}p_i(\theta_{ij})$.  Output $\pi_i$ and $x_{i,j}$ for $j\in\mathcal{M}$. 

\item\textbf{PartialEval $(j,\{x_{ij}\}_{i\in\mathcal{N}})\xrightarrow[]{}y_j$}\\
Compute and output $y_j = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}$.

\item\textbf{PartialProof $(j,\{x_{ij}\}_{i\in\mathcal{N}})\xrightarrow[]{}\sigma_j$}\\
Compute and output $\sigma_j = \prod_{i=1}^n g^{x_{ij}} =  g^{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}}= g^{y_j}=\mathcal{H}(y_j)$.

\item\textbf{FinalEval $(\{y_j\}_{j\in\mathcal{M}})\xrightarrow[]{}y$}\\
Compute and output $y = \sum_{i=1}^n y_{j}$.

\item\textbf{FinalProof $(\{\sigma_j\}_{j\in\mathcal{M}})\xrightarrow[]{}\sigma$}\\
Compute and output $\sigma = \prod_{j=1}^n \sigma_j = \prod_{j=1}^m g^{y_{j}} =  g^{\sum_{j=1}^m y_{j}}= g^{y}=\mathcal{H}(y)$.

\item\textbf{Verify $(\{\pi_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{N}},x,y)\xrightarrow[]{}\{0,1\}$}\\
Compute and output $\sigma= \prod_{i=1}^n \pi_i \wedge \prod_{i=1}^n \pi_i = \mathcal{H}(y)$.
\end{itemize}
\label{alg:VAHSS-HSS}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection*{Correctness, Security and Verifiability}
A HSS/additive-HSS construction should satisfy  two requirements: \textit{Correctness} and \textit{Security}. A verifiable additive HSS should also satisfy \textit{Verifiability}. The requirements are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correctness} It must hold that Pr$\Big[\textbf{Verify}(\{\pi_i\}_{i\in\mathcal{N}},\sigma,y)=1\Big]=1$. This means that with probability $1$ the output $y$ from \mathbb{FinalEval} is accepted given all parties where honest and the protocol were executed correctly.
    \item \textbf{Security} Let $T$ define the set of corrupted servers such that $|T|<m$, i.e at least one server is honest.  Denote a PPT adversary by $\mathcal{A}_1$ and let the Adv$(1^\lambda,\mathcal{A},T):= \text{Pr}[b' = b]-1/2$ be the advantage of $\mathcal{A}=\{\mathcal{A}_1,\mathcal{D}\}$ in guessing $b$ in the following experiment:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The adversary $\mathcal{A}_1$ gives $(i,x_i,x_i')$ to the challenger, where $i\in[n], x_i\neq x_i'$ and $|x_i|=|x_i'|$.
        \item The challenger picks a bit $b\in\{0,1\}$ uniformly at random chooses and computes $\textbf{ShareSecret}(1^\lambda,i,\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i) = (\hat{\text{share}}_{i1},...,\hat{\text{share}}_{im},\pi_i)$, where $\hat{\textbf{x}}_i$ is  such that $\hat{\textbf{x}}_i = \begin{cases}x_i, \text{ if } b=0 \\ x_i' \text{ else} \end{cases}$. 
        \item Given the shares from the corrupted servers T and $\hat{\pi}_i$ the adversary distinguisger outputs a guess $b'\xleftarrow[]{}\mathcal{D}((\hat{\text{share}_{ij}})_{j|s_j\in T},\hat{\pi}_i)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    A VAHSS-construction is $t$-secure if for all $T\subset \{s_1,...,s_m\}$ with $|T|<t$ it holds that Adv$(1^\lambda,\mathcal{A},T)<\varepsilon(\lambda)$ for some negligible $\varepsilon(\lambda)$.
 \item \textbf{Verifiability} Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote any PPT  adversary and $T$ denote the set of corrupted servers with $T\leq m$. The verifiability property requires that any $\mathcal{A}$ who can modify the input shares to all servers $s_j\in T$ can cause a wrong value to be excepted as $y=f(x_1,...,x_n)$ with negligible probability.   
\end{itemize}
\\
The VHASS in Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS} satisfies the correctness, security and verifiability requirements defined above, this is stated in Theorem \ref{thm:VAHSS_CSV} 
\\
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:VAHSS_CSV}
Construction \ref{alg:VAHSS-HSS} satisfies the correctness, security and verifiability requirements described above.

\section{Constructions for verifying clients input}
\label{sec:RF_theory}
Range proofs allows a prover to convince a verifier that the value of a secret is in an allowed range, zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) does this with out revealing any other information about the secret. Here ZKRP constructed to prove the following statement about a secret $x$ is considered:
\begin{align*}
    \{(g,h\in\mathds{G},C;x,R\in\mathds{F})\::\:C= g^x h^R \wedge x \in \{\textit{"predetermined allowed range"}\}
\end{align*}
Note that in the above statement  it is assumed that $x$ is the secret in a Pedersen commitment, which is not required for range proofs however only such range proof will be studied in this paper. The range which $x$ is proved to belong to may vary between different constructions and will be more precisely defied below for the separate constructions. 

Let's denote the two parties prover and verifier as  $\mathcal{P}$ respectively $\mathcal{V}$. After successfully performing a range proof  $\mathcal{P}$ has convinced $\mathcal{V}$, that the secret $x$ in a Pedersen commitment $C$ is in an predetermined allowed range (or set) without $\mathcal{V}$ learning anything else about $x$.

There exists several constructions for range proofs and this paper will only investigate two for potential extensions of the VAHSS-construction described above to ensure clients honesty. Before presenting these two a XXX will be given to motivate the choice of these two ZKRP. (TODO )Square based range proofs \cite{Efficient_proof_interval} %what is is and why do not use. 
Another construction which could be used to construct a prove that a value is in an allowed range is function secret sharing \cite{FSS} % explain what and why not use.

In the subsections below theory and construction of \textit{Signature based range proofs} and \textit{bulletproofs} are presented.

%$\mathds{Z}_n, n=p\cdot q$

%The Fujisaki-Okamoto Commitment Scheme differense from pedersen? 

\subsection{Signature-based  range proof}
First the zero knowledge set membership (ZKSM) is described and then extended to a ZKRP, originally presented in \cite{RANGE-SET}. Both the ZKSM and ZKRP constructions presented are modified compared to the original construction according to the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to be non-interactive.

The idea behind the ZKSM (and also the later derived ZKRP) is that for each element in the allowed set $\Phi$ there exist a public commitment, denoted $A_i\: \forall i\in\Phi$. The prover who aims to prove that the secret hidden by a pre published Pedesen commitment, denoted $C$, is in the allowed range $\Phi$ chooses the commitment representing the the secret $x$, i.e $A_x$. Then hides this choice by raising $A_x$  to a random value $\tau\in_R\mathds{F}$, this gives $V = A_x^\tau$, and publishes $V$. Then the prover has to convince the verifier that  1) the published value $V$ is indeed equal to  $A_x^\tau$ where $A_x$ is from the allowed set  2) the secret in the Pedersen commitment $C$  is the same as the secret hidden by $V$.
%The first two constructions that will be considered here are based on the range proofs presented in \cite{RANGE-SET} and adjusted to a non-interactive construction described by \cite{ZKRP_Morais}. The transformation from a interactive protocol to a non interactive is done via the Fiat-Schit principle \cite{fiat-schmit}.  Non-interactive means that there communication between the prover and verifies while XXX Find. 
%Construction \ref{alg:ZKSM} is a non interactive set membership proof of a Pedersen commitment $C=g^\sigma h^R$, where $\sigma$ is the secret and $R\in_R\mathds{F}$ is chosen uniformly at random.
%The construction allows a prover, that knows the secret $x$, to convince the verifier, who has access to the commitment $C$, that $x\in\Phi$ for some predetermined set $\Phi$ without revealing any other information regarding the secret $x$.  
In Construction \ref{alg:ZKSM}  a detailed description of the ZKSM algorithms that both constructs the public commitments and convinces the verifier of the above statements is given. 
%This construction fulfils the zero knowledge requirements described in \ref{sec:ZK} and is a non interactive zero knowledge set membership proof. 
\begin{algorithm}[]

Put $a=e(V,g)^{-s}e(g,g)^t$, $D=g^sh^m$ and $c=\text{Hash}(V,a,D)$. Finally compute $z_x = s-x c$, $z_R = m-Rc$ and $z_\tau= t-\tau c$ then construct and publish $\textit{proof} = (V,a,D,z_x,z_R,z_\tau)$.

\end{itemize}
\label{alg:ZKSM}
\end{algorithm}

The ZKSM construction can be turned into a efficient zero knowledge range proof by rewriting the secret $x$ in base $u$ such that,
\begin{align*}
    x = \sum_{j=0}^{l-1} x_ju^j.
\end{align*}
Optimal choice of the two parameters $u,l$ is described in \cite{RANGE-SET}. 
Using this notation it follows that if $x_j\in[0,u)\: \forall j\in\mathds{Z}_l$, then $x\in[0,u^l)$. A remark is that range for the subscript $j$ is $[0,l-1]$ and not $[0,l]$.  This has been wrongly notated \cite{RANGE-SET,ZKRP_Morais} and therefore an explicit proof of this is given in Appendix \ref{appendix:range}. Construction \ref{alg:ZKRP} is a modification of construction \ref{alg:ZKSM} into a non interactive zero knowledge range proof using the above decomposition of the secret $x$.

This ZKRP construction can be generalised to  prove membership to an arbitrary interval $[a,b]$ where $a>0$ and  $\:b>a$, by showing  that $x\in[a,a+u^l)$ and $x\in[b-u^l,b)$, since then must hold that $x\in[a,b]$. Figure \ref{fig:interval} illustrates the intuition and correctness of the statement.  Proving $x\in[a,a+u^l)$ and $x\in[b-u^l,b)$ can easily be transferred into proving $x-a\in[0,u^l)$ and $x-b+u^l\in[0,u^l)$, since both $a,b$ are public. Therefore to prove a secret is in an arbitrary interval the steps \textbf{Prove} and \textbf{Verify} in construction \ref{alg:ZKRP} will have to be executed twice. Plus the  \textbf{Verify} algorithm has to be modified to include a \texttt{AND} operation to verify that  $x-a\in[0,u^l)$ \textit{and} $x-b+u^l\in[0,u^l)$.  In \cite{arbitary_range_opt} an optimised implementation is presented  reducing the complexity with a factor $2$. This rather small reduction is important when a verifier is required check the range of multiple clients secrets, which is the case in VAHSS where it is done once for each client.

\subsection{Bulletproofs}
Bulletproof is a range proof, logarithmic in the size of the range. The proof relies on the inner product argument which allows a prove to convince a verifier that he knows the opening $\bm{s},\bm{q}\in\mathds{F}^n$ to a Pedersen vector commitment $P_v = \bm{g}^{\bm{s}}\bm{h}^{\bm{q}}$ such that the inner product of $\bm{s},\bm{q}$ is equal to a known value, $c$. This can be done with a proof of size $log\: n$, compare to the trivial solution of publishing $\bm{s},\bm{q}$ which is a proof of size $n$.

\subsubsection*{Notation}
The description and construction or bulletproofs requires additional notation which will be presented here. First let lowercase bold font variables denote vectors, i.e $\mathbf{a}\in\mathds{F}^n$ is a vector with element $a_1,..,a_n \in \mathds{F}$, and uppercase bold font variables denote matrices, i.e $\mathbf{A}\in\mathds{F}^{n\times m}$ is a matrix and $a_{ij}$ the element of $\mathbf{A}$ at row $i$ and column $j$. Given this notation denote scalar multiplication with a vector as $\mathbf{b}=c\cdot \mathbf{a}\in\mathds{F}^n$, where $c\in\mathds{F}$ and  $b_i=c\cdot a_i, \: i\in\{1,...,n\}$. Denote the euclidean inner product of two vectors as $\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\rangle$ and Hadamard product as $\mathbf{a}\circ \mathbf{b}$.

Further consider vector polynomials $p(X)$ of degree $d$ on the form $p(X)=\sum_{i=0}^d \mathbf{p_i}\cdot X^i\in\mathds{F}^n[X]$, where the coefficients $\mathbf{p_i}\in\mathds{F}^n$. The inner product of two vector polynomials, $l(X),r(X)$ is defined as, 
\begin{align*}
    \langle l(X),r(X)\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^d\sum_{j=0}^n \langle l_i,r_j\rangle \cdot X^{i+j}\in\mathds{F}[X].
\end{align*}
The following is equivalent: evaluating two polynomials at $x$ then taking the inner product versus taking the inner product polynomial at $x$.

Let $\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}$ denote the concatenation of two vectors. Python notation will be used to denote sections of vectors such that $\mathbf{a}_{[:l]} = (a_1,...,a_l)$ and $\mathbf{a}_{[l:]} = (a_{l+1},...,a_n)$ for $l\in[1,n]$. 

For $k\in\mathds{F}^*$ let $\mathbf{k}^n=(1,k,k^2,...,k^{n-1})$, i.e the vector containing the $n$ fist powers of $k$. 

Let $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}\in\mathds{G}^n$ and remember that $\mathbf{a}\in\mathds{F}^n$ then define $C= \mathbf{g}^\mathbf{a} = \prod_{i=1}^ng_i^{a_i}\in\mathds{G}$, where $C$ can be interpreted as a commitment to the vector $\mathbf{a}$. In this section the two vectors $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}$ will be considered to be generators of the space $\mathds{G}^n$.

Remark that in here $n$ denotes the dimension of the room not the number of clients as earlier, further remark that the dimension of the room is the length of the bit representation of the secret in the Pedersen vector commitment considered below or if not the bit representation is padded with zeros.

\subsubsection*{Inner product argument}
\label{sec:inner_prod}
The bulletproof construction is based on the inner product argument which will be closer presented in this section. Remember that the inner product argument is a argument of knowledge of $\textbf{s},\mathbf{q}$ in a  Pedersen vector commitment $P_v=\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{s}\mathbf{h}^\mathbf{q}$ satisfying a given inner product denoted $c$. 
%(To differ from the Pedersen vector commitment considered here and the Pedersen commitment in the range proofs the exponents in the commit are denoted $\mathbf{s},\mathbf{r}$ instead of $\sigma,R$, and the commitment by $P_v$) 
More formally the argument is a proof system of the statement,
\begin{align*}
    \{(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}\in\mathds{G}^n,\:P_v\in\mathds{G},\:c\in\mathds{F};\: \mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\in\mathds{F}^n) : \: P_v=\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{s}\mathbf{h}^\mathbf{q}\wedge\: c =\langle\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\rangle\}
\end{align*}
Which can be shown to be equivalent to a proof of the statement,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:IPA}
    \{(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}\in\mathds{G}^n,\: u,P_v\in\mathds{G};\: \mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\in\mathds{F}^n) : \: P_v=\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{s}\mathbf{h}^\mathbf{q}u^{\langle\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}\rangle}\}.
\end{align}

A logarithmic sized proof of the above inner product statement is presented in Construction \ref{alg:inner_product}. The construction presented is modified compared to the one presented in \cite{bulletProofs_theory} to be non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

Let $x=\text{Hash}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},P_v,c) \in\mathds{F}^*$ and compute $P_v'= u^{x\cdot c}P$. Then define the two vectors $\mathbf{l},\mathbf{r}$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the dimension of the vectors $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}$ is one drop the bold font in the notation and publish the proof $\textit{ proof}_{IP}=(g,h,P_v',u^x,s,r,\mathbf{l},\mathbf{r})$.
    \item  Otherwise:  Let $n'=n/2$ and define  $c_L=\langle a_{[:,n']},b_{[n',:]} \rangle$ and $c_R=\langle a_{[n',:]},b_{[:,n']} \rangle$. Then use these variables to calculate $L=\mathbf{g}_{[n':]}^{\mathbf{a}_{[:n']}} \mathbf{h}_{[:n']}^{\mathbf{b}_{[n':]}} u^{c_L}$ and $R=\mathbf{g}_{[:n']}^{\mathbf{a}_{[n':]}} \mathbf{h}_{[n':]}^{\mathbf{b}_{[:n']}} u^{c_R}$. Further store the current values of $L,R\in\mathds{G}$, by appending them to the vectors $\mathbf{l}$ resp $\mathbf{r}$. Now update $x=\text{Hash}(L,R)$, and recalculate $\mathbf{g} = \mathbf{g}_{[:n']}^{x^{-1}}\mathbf{g}_{[n':]}^{x}$, $\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{h}_{[:n']}^{x}\mathbf{h}_{[n':]}^{x^{-1}}$ and the commitment $P'=L^{x^2}PR^{x^{-2}}$. Finally update the exponents $\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}$ to $\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{s}_{[:n']}+\mathbf{s}_{[n':]}x^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}_{[:n']}x^{-1}+\mathbf{q}_{[n':]}x$. Run the step \textbf{Prove}$(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},P_v',n',\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s})$ with the updated variables. Note that the vectors $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q}$ now have the dimension $n'=n/2$, hence performing the recursion until one-dimensional vectors will require $log\:n$ iterations.
\end{itemize}
\item\text{\textbf{Verify} $(g,h,C,\textit{proof})\xrightarrow[]{}\{0,1\}$}\\
For $i\in\{0,log(n)\}$ put $n=n/2$ and $x=\text{Hash}(\bm{l}[i],\bm{r}[i])$, then update the vectors $\bm{g}$ and $\bm{h}$ as well as the  variable $P$ according to, $\bm{g}= \bm{g}_{[:,n]}^{x^{-1}}\bm{g}_{[n,:]}^{x}$, $\bm{h}= \bm{h}_l{[:,n]}^{x}\bm{h}_{[n,:]}^{x^{-1}}$ and $ P = L^{x^2}PR^{x^{-2}}  $. After iterating over all $i$ the dimension of the vectors $\bm{g},\bm{h}$ is one and we can drop the bold font. Accept if $c=\langle s,r\rangle$ and $P =g^sh^r$.
\end{itemize}
\label{alg:inner_product}
\end{algorithm}

%The setup phase of construction \ref{alg:inner_product} is intently left out since to avoid a trusted third party a \textit{Nothing up my sleeve} strategy will be used and is described separately in  section \ref{sec:NOMS}.
 
Remark that the inner product argument is sound but not zero-knowledge since information about $\bm{s},\bm{\bar{s}}$ is relieved.

\subsubsection*{Inner product rang proof}
Lets present a logarithmic sized range proof called \textit{bulletproof}, based, on the inner product argument. This construction allows a prover, given a Pedersen commitment $C=g^x h^R$ to convince a verifier that the secret $x$ belongs to the interval $[0,2^n)$. By convincing the verifier that  $\bm{x}\in\{0,1\}^n$ is the binary representation of the secret $x$, or equivalently that $x= \langle \bm{x},\mathbf{2}^n\rangle $ and that the prover knows $\bm{x}$.
   % \item $\bm{\bar{x}}$ is the component-wise complement of $\bm{x}$. This is equivalent to show that $\bm{\bar{x}}$ satisfies the two conditions: $\bm{\bar{x}}\circ \bm{x}=\bm{0}^n$ and $\bm{\bar{x}} = \bm{x} -\bm{1}^n \: \text{mod }2$.
%\end{itemize}
This can be shown to be done by proving the following statement;
\begin{align}
    \big\langle \bm{x} -z\cdot \bm{1}^n, \bm{y}^n\circ (\bm{\bar{x}} + z \cdot\bm{1}^n) + z^2\cdot\bm{2}^n \big\rangle = z^2\cdot x+ \delta(y,z),
    \label{eq:range_non_zero}
\end{align}
where $\bar{\bm{x}}$ is the component-wise complement of $\bm{x}$ and $\delta(y,z) = (z-z^2)\cdot\langle\bm{1}^n,\bm{y}^n\rangle-z^3\langle \bm{1}^n,\bm{2}^n\rangle\in\mathds{F}$.
The values $z$ and $y$ are either chosen at random from the set $\mathds{F}$ by the verifier in an interactive construction or are the output of a hash function in a non-interactive construction. Here a non-interactive construction will be considered. 

Directly using  a inner product argument presented in Construction \ref{alg:inner_product} to prove the statement  in equation \eqref{eq:range_non_zero} would leak information about $x$, since information about the two vectors $\bm{x},\bm{\bar{x}}$ is revealed, i.e the binary representation of $x$. Hence two new vectors $\bm{s}_1,\bm{s}_2$ are introduced and will serve as blinding vectors and help construct a zero-knowledge range proof even if the inner product argument is not a zero knowledge construction. Given this idea, the inner product in \eqref{eq:range_non_zero} is tweaked to include the two blinding vectors and the new statement is to prove the inner product of is,
\begin{align*}
     t(X) &= \langle  l(X),r(X)\rangle = t_0 + t_1\cdot X + t_2\cdot X^2\\
    l(X) &= \bm{x} -z\cdot \bm{1}^n +\bm{s}_1\cdot X\\
    r(X) &= \bm{y}^n\circ (\bm{\bar{x}} + z \cdot\bm{1}^n + \bm{s}_2\cdot X)+ z^2\cdot\bm{2}^n,\\
\end{align*}
Note that $t_0 = z^2\cdotx + \delta(y,z)$ which is equal to the right hand side of equation \eqref{eq:range_non_zero}. Further it holds that $t_1 = \langle \bm{x}-z\cdot \bm{1}^n , \bm{y}^n\circ \bm{s_R}\rangle + \langle\bm{s_L},\bm{y}^n\circ (\bm{a_R}+z\cdot\bm{1}^n) + z\cdot \bm{2}^n\rangle$ and $t_2 =\langle \bm{s_L}, \bm{y}^n \circ \bm{s_R}\rangle $. Given these vectors and innner product Construction \ref{alg:bullet} gives a non interactive zero knowledge range proof that the secret $x$ belongs to the interval $[0,2^n]$.

\begin{itemize}
\item\text{\textbf{Prove} $(g,h,\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h},P,n,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s})\xrightarrow[]{}\textit{ proof}_{RP}$}\\
Let $\bm{x}$ denote the binary representation of the secret $x$ in the commitment $P$ and $\bar{\bm{x}}$ the component-wise complement such  that $\bm{x}\circ \bar{\bm{x}} = 0$. Construct the commitment $A= h^\alpha \bm{g}^{\bm{x}} \bm{h}^\bar{\bm{x}}$, where $\alpha\in_R\mathds{F}$. Then chose the two blinding vectors $\bm{s_R},\bm{s_L}\in_R\mathds{F}^n$ and the value $\rho\in_R\mathds{F}$ and compute the commitment $S=h^\rho \bm{g}^{\bm{s_L}}\bm{h}^\bm{s_R}$. Let $y=\text{Hash}(A,S)$, $z=\text{Hash}(A,S,y)$ and $\tau_1,\tau_2\in_R\mathds{F}$. Now the it is possible to construct $t_1,t_2$ defined above. Given this let $T_1=g^{t_1}h^{\tau_1}$ and $T_2=g^{t_1}h^{\tau_1}$, next let $X=\text{Hash}(T_1,T_2)$. Now construct the two vectors for the inner product argument: $\bm{l} = \bm{x}-z\cdot \bm{1}^n-\bm{s_L}\cdot X$, $\bm{r}= \bm{y}^n\circ(\bar{\bm{x}}+ z\cdot \bm{1}^n+\bm{s_R}\cdot X ) + z^2\ X $ and calculate the inner product $\hat{t} = \langle \bm{l},\bm{r}\rangle$. Finally compute $\tau_X = \tau_2 x^2 + \tau_1 X + z^2 R$ and $\mu = \alpha+ R\:X$.  Now use the inner product argumen.  First let $P_v = \bm{g}^{\bm{l}}\bm{h}^\bm{r}$ and  secondly compute the step \textbf{Prove}  of Construction \ref{alg:inner_product}  with the input $(\bm{g},\bm{h},P_v,\hat{t},\bm{l},\bm{r})$ and store the output \textit{proof$_{IP}$}. Combine and publish  the proof: $\textit{proof}_{RP} = (\tau_X, \mu , \hat{t}, P, A, S, T_1, T_2 , P_v ,\textit{proof}_{IP}) $.

\item\text{\textbf{Verify} $(g,h,C,\textit{proof})\xrightarrow[]{}\{0,1\}$}\\
Compute the three hash functions $y= \text{Hash}(A,S)$, $z= \text{Hash}(A,S,y)$ and $X= \text{Hash}(T_1,T_2)$. Then given  $y,z,X$ compute $h_i' = h_i ^{y^{-i+1}}$ for all $i\in\{1,...,n\}$, $P_l = P\cdot h\mu$ and $P_r = A\cdot S ^x \bm{g}^ {-z}\bm{h'}^{z\bm{y}^n+z^2\cdot \bm{2}^n}$. Then check if the following equalities hold: $P_l\overset{?}{=} P_r \wedge g^{\hat{t}}h^{\tau_X} \overset{?}{=}  P ^{z^2}\:g^{\delta(y,z)}\:T_1^x\:T_2^{x^2}$ and if the output of \textbf{Verify} in Construction \ref{alg:inner_product} on the input $(\text{proof}_{IP})$ is $1$. If all three criterion is fulfilled then the secret  $x$ in the commitment $P$ is in the range $[0,2^n]$.
\end{itemize}
\label{alg:bullet}
\end{algorithm}

An optimised version of bulletproof where one prover wishes to verify the range of several commitments reduces the proof size from growing multiplicatively in the number of commits to additive. More precisely lets a assume a prover wants to prove the range of $k$ commits a naive implementation would lead to a proof size of $k\cdot log_2 n $, but an optimised implementation reduces this to $log_2 n + 2 log_2 k$.  With a similar approach as presented for the signature based range proofs, illustrated in  Figure \ref{fig:interval},  bulletproof can also be generalised to arbitrary ranges $[a,b]$, where $a>0$ and $b>a$.  This would then increase the proof size with the additive term $2log_2 2 = 2$.
